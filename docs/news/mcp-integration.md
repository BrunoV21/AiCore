### ðŸš€ MCP Integration Now Available via FastMCP

We're excited to announce support for **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration** through **FastMCP**!

This new feature allows LLM providersâ€”including **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, **Deepseek**, and **Anthropic** - to connect to external MCP servers using **tool calling**. This enables more dynamic, configurable interactions between your LLMs and external systems.

Check out the new module in `aicore/llm/mcp`, updated configuration options in `LlmConfig`, and an example integration in `async_llm_call_with_mcp.py`.
