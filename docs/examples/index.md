# Example Implementations

Welcome to the AiCore Examples documentation! This section provides practical implementations demonstrating AiCore's capabilities across different use cases and integration patterns.

## Getting Started with Examples

To run any of these examples:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Configure your environment variables (see [.env-example](../config/.env-example))
4. Run the example scripts

## Featured Examples

### Basic Usage
- [Simple LLM Call](./simple_llm_call.md) - Basic synchronous usage
- [Async LLM Call](./simple_async_llm_call.md) - Asynchronous operations

### Application Integrations
- [Chainlit Demo](./chainlit.md) - Interactive chat application with UI
- [FastAPI Service](./fastapi.md) - Production-ready API service implementation

### Advanced Features
